# Machine Learning Approach to Job Shop Scheduling Problem

## Abstract
Resource constraints occur when the amount of resrouce does not met the demand. While these problems are more common in manufacturing settings, the range of the problem can encompases anything from project management to suplly chain logistics. Due to the complexity of these type of problems, they are best handle by a professional scheduler, project manager, or a planner. However, this create a scenario with a lot of pressure since these professionals has to think of various scenario to fit a 24 hour schedule and that only cover tthe best scenario without any reworks. In this study, I'm leveraging a [resource-constrained dataset](https://ptal.github.io/scheduling-data.html) provided by the researchers from [AbSolute](https://ptal.github.io/README.html) to develop a data science/machine learning approach to the resource-constrained problem.
